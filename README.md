# NTDS project: Transitional playlists for new musical discoveries

This project is done in the frame of the EPFL course *Network tour of data science*.
The main goal is to take some of the most listened tracks found in the *Free Music Archive* and help someone wishing to discover a new style or a new artist to transition smoothly from a song he knows and likes to an other unknown music. Basically the idea is to let the user choose two tracks within a list and return him a 10-tracks playlist gradually changing from musics similar to the first track to others more like the the second track.
