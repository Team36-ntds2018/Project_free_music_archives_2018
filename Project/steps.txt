NTDS:

Steps:
	-choose features/genres and create adjacency
	-get graph from adjacency
	-ask user for two different nodes
	-compute all the paths between the two nodes
	-compute the signal over each path
	-compute the smoothness over each path
	-choose the path with the lowest smoothness
	-get the corresponding nodes in order

Choices:
	- what features/genres do we choose ?
	- what signal do we compute ? (the same features, a different one,  echonest...)
